    <h3>How to Make ghorme sabzi Step-By-Step</h3>
    <p>
      Ghormeh Sabzi is a traditional Persian stew made with finely chopped
      herbs, kidney beans, dried limes, and meat, usually beef or lamb. To
      prepare it, sauté chopped onions in oil, add turmeric, then brown the
      meat. Stir in the mixed herbs (parsley, cilantro, chives, and fenugreek)
      and cook until fragrant, then add kidney beans, dried limes, salt, and
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the stew simmer slowly for several hours until the meat is tender and
      the flavors are well developed. The herbs should darken and the stew
      should become thick and aromatic. Ghormeh Sabzi is typically served with
      steamed Persian rice.
