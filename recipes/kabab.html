    <h3>How to Make kabab-koobideh Step-By-Step</h3>
    <p>
      Persian Kabab Koobideh is a classic Iranian grilled dish made from finely
      ground meat, traditionally a mix of lamb and beef, combined with grated
      onion, salt, and pepper. The key to a good koobideh is the texture of the
      meat and onion: the onion is grated and thoroughly squeezed to remove
      excess juice, ensuring the mixture binds well and does not fall off the
      skewers. The meat is kneaded well until it becomes smooth and sticky,
      which helps it hold together during grilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seasoned meat is shaped by hand onto wide metal skewers and cooked
      over hot charcoal, where it develops a smoky flavor and a slightly charred
      exterior while staying juicy inside. During grilling, the kababs are often
      brushed with melted butter or saffron water for extra aroma. Kabab
      Koobideh is typically served with basmati rice, grilled tomatoes, raw
      onions, and herbs, making it one of the most popular and beloved Persian
      meals.
