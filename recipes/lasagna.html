    <h3>How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step</h3>
    <p>
      To make a simple lasagna, start by preparing the meat sauce. Brown ground
      beef in a pan with chopped onion and garlic, then drain excess fat. Add
      tomato sauce, salt, pepper, and a pinch of Italian seasoning, and let it
      simmer for 10–15 minutes. In a separate bowl, mix ricotta cheese with an
      egg and a little salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). In a baking dish, layer cooked lasagna
      noodles, meat sauce, the ricotta mixture, and shredded mozzarella cheese.
      Repeat the layers until ingredients are used, finishing with sauce and
      mozzarella on top. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan.
